# SpiritBolt
A fresh new iteration of my very first ability I've ever created.

## Description
SpiritBolt is a highly focused version of the Avatar's SpiritBeam. By concentrating on your power output, you are able to fire multiple shots of a destructive beam of spirit energy!

## Instructions
Hold sneak until charged (when particles are centered), then left click to fire a bolt.
